Hey Actor,
You are doing great!
I didn't expect that you would be able to fool everybody as impressively you are doing the job!

By the way, you have something important to do now.
Go to our base in "6G:653" and launch all the normal missiles and set a timer of 4 hours for launching our "Fat Boy", I mean the nuclear one.
Take half of your army with you as you need to defend the launching site and send others after Tony and James.

I've already sent the password for activating the normal missiles.
And here are the clue keys for activating the Fat Boy:

- T3NR1NG$
- T3nR1ng$
- TenRings
- T3nR!ngs
- T3nR!ng$
- 73NR1GN$
- 73nRing$
- T3nR!nG$

I believe, you already know which one is the valid key. 
Just giving the clues to give you a simple recall.

So, get to the work! And don't forget to make a public broadcast 5 minutes before you launch the missile.

Announce a war against Tony and James.
If Tony surrenders, then stop the timer of Fat Boy.
Otherwise, let the destruction happen!

Hahahahahahaha!

Oh, the password for deactivating the nuclear missile is "IihsIb_7[^7is<inH][l_^D`Ib_;[n7iu"

The password is encrypted and I believe, you know how to decode that, my boy!

That's all for now.
Work according the instruction and then wait for my next instruction.

Regards,
Mandarin
